**Introduction**
*This application is about sanitation facilities available to people of different countries.
*The data (Improved sanitation, overall access (%)) is taken from 
[Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data)

**To use this application**
1. choose a continent, then 
2. choose a country from that continent.
You can view the improvement the country has attained from 1990 to 2010.

**Note**
The data is cleaned so that only countries that have complete data from 1990 to 2010 are considered.
A column 'Continent' is added to the dataset after cleaning.
All files are in this [Sanitation App](https://github.com/kurunaadan/Sanitation_App/) Github repository
